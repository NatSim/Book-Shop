# Hey Natasha, this is a Markdown file, has the `.md` extension...
# Markdown is widely used. Its purpose is to document, in a professional way, the code you produce.

- It is nice because GitHub renders the `.md` files in a nice way that the human eye can read easier, just like HTML.

- Essentially it is just text files like the `.txt` but you can appply in them some formats specified in Markdown


## BTW, Natasha, you can apply different titles like `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>` and so on in HTML, but in Markdown they have another syntax...


### Let me Go with a link, so you can have a look:

- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), a nice person in GitHub sharing all to be ready for copy&paste in your own `.md` files.

- Have a look, its interesting, titles, paragraphs, there are even tables...




### I am telling you all this, because it easy and because its handy.

When it comes to create stuf like `thecodinghacks.txt`, if you do it a Markdown, `thecodinghacks.md`...

Then you can see how cool&easy to read are commands when they are specified within the quotes in markdown.

Way much easier to see `mkdir MY_DIR_NAME` is a command, and therefore, to select it and copy.

Just by using the quotes ``` (one at the beginning and one at the end of the `word` you want to be shown like `this` :) hehehe)
